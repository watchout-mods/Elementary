Exporting
---------

The original composition file is HUD-Elements.svg. Due to how important it is to
have EXACT rendering of all textures, this was done using Inkscape & SVG, then
exported to PNG and eventually converted to BLP (because Alpha channel did not
work out properly when using PNG).

To export one element of HUD-Elements using Inkscape

* Select the surrounding rectangle. This is used to define the export area. The
  rectangles are named by their intended PNG file name.
* Hide all other elements using the Layers
*
